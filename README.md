# WinCalendar
A Simple Place to Watch Your Day
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Are you annoyed by the default Windows 10 calendar app? Which goes away if you uninstall the mail app? Yeah! Me too!

This is by far the smallest calendar app you will find in the Internet. This is made for low-end PCs as well as for people who
don't like to spend much space just for a calendar.

Enjoy!
